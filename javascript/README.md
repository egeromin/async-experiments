# Javascript Email Cruncher

Javascript version of email cruncher.

To run, simply open 'app.html' as a file in Firefox. This will not work in Chrome because Chrome doesn't allow javascript workers when serving from the filesystem. Alternatively, serve the static files in this directory from a webserver and it'll work on Chrome as well.
